            Technology has been evolving. From the past decades, we've seen a
            surge of developments in the field of technology. There have been
            many advancements made in technology. Everyone can access most of
            their things through their smartphones nowadays. We have been so
            immersed in technology that we are being dependent on it. Since I am
            studying computing, I use technology most of my days. As most things
            have both advantages and disadvantages, using too much technology
            has its advantages and disadvantages.

            <h2>Advantages</h2>
            <p class="font">
              Technology has helped the world reach states we never thought
              would be possible. I remember I used to go to my friend’s house
              just to call him to go play somewhere or to talk to him. Nowadays,
              I can just phone call or even video call him to chat with my
              friends, make plans, and play games. I can watch movies and videos
              in my house without going to the cinemas. We have a small world
              inside our pockets. Social media helps us to socialize with people
              from all around the world. I have made many friends from other
              countries with the help of social media. Also, during these harsh
              times of COVID, everyone has to stay at home to be safe. The
              schools and work of most people are made online. My college is
              currently operating online. If I want to learn some others courses
              many websites can teach us many new things. Some even teach us for
              free.

              <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
              <p class="font">
                Compared to other things I believe that technology has fewer
                disadvantages than advantages. Some advanced technology has made
                people very lazy. We’ve become lazy to do some simple tasks and
                hope for scientists or inventors to make it automated. I get on
                social media most of the time. Most of my days are wasted on
                social media. I find myself constantly looking at my phone
                checking Facebook or Instagram. I used to go out a lot before
                but nowadays I just want to stay inside my house and play games
                or watch videos. I believe I’ve been somewhat dependent on
                technology. But being too dependent and being addicted to
                technology is a bad thing.

        One can also say technology is the best thing. If we can get internet
        connections and network to the rural areas, they won’t have to walk 2-3
        hours to get to school. They can learn at home while the education is
        given properly. Newer technologies with more advanced options are made
        almost day by day. Compared to the past years and decades, technology
        nowadays has made our life very easier. The works that needed hours to
        do can be done in some minutes. There is much potential for technology
        in the future.
