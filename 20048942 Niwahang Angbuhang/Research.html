          <!--A link is inserted to a site-->
          <a href="https://www.upshotmedia.in/"><h2>Upshot Media</h2></a>
           <!-- Creating a Div class for every section-->
          <div class="Images" >
            <!--Image is inserted and given class and id-->
          <img class="Research" id="1" src="Research/1.png" />

          <!-- A button is added to do a function -->
        <button onclick="toggle1()">Toggle Image</button><br>
          <br />
             I saw the Upshot media webpage and decided to make a home page like theirs. A background image and then a text in the middle. The background image is added through CSS and is position is set to center with 100% width and height. There were many div tags used in the website to align the text in the middle and there was a link just down below. For me, I've done the same with the background and a text in the middle including the link itself.

        <!--A link is inserted to a site-->

          ><h2>Marcus Artis</h2></a
        >
        <div class="Images">
          <!--Image is inserted and given class and id-->
          <img class="Research" id="2"src="Research/2.png" />
          <img class="Research" id="22" src="Research/2,1.png" style="display: none;" >
        </div>
        <!-- A button is added to do a function -->
        <button onclick="toggle2()">Toggle Image</button><br>
        <br />
        For the contacts page,  I used the the page of Marcus Artis as a reference. The contact form is in the right side of the page in Marcus Artis's page while mine is on the left side. He has a navigation panel on the left side. Since I have a navigation bar at the top, I've added my social media links on the right side of the contacts page.

        <img class="Research" id="3" src="Research/3.png" />
        <img class="Research" id="33" src="Research/3,1.png" style="display: none;" >

        <!-- A button is added to do a function -->
        <button onclick="toggle3()">Toggle Image</button><br>
        <br />
        For the blog page, I've taken reference from Assemble website. In their website they've used an image and headers and footers. A heading then a paragraph is written accordingly. I used a similar design for my blog. An introduction first then a picture is added. Below the picture, advantages and disadvantages are parted left and right. On the footer, conclusion is written.
      </li>
      <li>
        <!--A link is inserted to a site-->
        <a href="https://www.scottsantens.com/bio"><h2>Scott Santens</h2></a>
        <div class="Images">
          <!--Image is inserted and given class and id-->
        <img class="Research" id="4" src="Research/4.png" />
        <img class="Research" id="44" src="Research/4,1.png" style="display: none;" >
        </div>
        <!-- A button is added to do a function -->
        <button onclick="toggle4()">Toggle Image</button><br>
        <br />
        For the CV part, I've taken Scott Santens website as a reference. He has separated his CV into two parts: left and right and used heading tags and unordered lists with no style to write the information for his CV. For my page, I've done a similar thing. Parting the information left and right. Personal information about me on the left and other information on the right.
      </li>
      <li>
        <!--A link is inserted to a site-->
        <a href="http://www.tejucole.com/"><h2>Teju Cole</h2></a>
        <div class="Images">
          <!--Image is inserted and given class and id-->
        <img class="Research" id="5" src="Research/5.png" />
        <img class="Research" id="55" src="Research/5,1.png" style="display: none;" >
        </div>
        <!-- A button is added to do a function -->
        <button onclick="toggle5()">Toggle Image</button><br>
        <br />
        Finally, for the navigationbar, I've used Teju Cole webpage as a reference. He has made a simple navaigation bar. An unordered list is used for the navigation bar. The navigation bar is made inside a border box. For my navigation bar, it is aligned to the center and background is made transparent so the background image is visible.
